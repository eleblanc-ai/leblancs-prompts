## About

I've been a contracting Prompt Engineer with [Scale AI](https://scale.com/) and [Remotasks](https://www.remotasks.com/en) since March of 2023. In this work,  I help train generative AI on various topics, including science, mathematics, and coding. My primary responsibilities include crafting high-quality prompts for various applications and ensuring data quality. I've participated in multiple special projects in prompt development and quality review. I'm looking forward to the opportunity to bring my training and experience into new domains.

My background is in Computer Science (B.S., M.S., PhD). My research interests primarily include knowledge representation and reasoning, logic, causality, and natural language processing. In my PhD work, I developed a theoretical framework for reasoning about actual causation. The approach involves looking at a sequence of events to determine which action or actions brought about an outcome of interest. I also implemented the framework in a logic programming language called Answer Set Programming (ASP). I also did a fellowship with the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory from 2019-2021. During that time, I developed a novel logical framework based on literature about the psychology of how humans reason about norm violations. I demonstrated a proof-of-concept in an NRL-developed cognitive system.

From late 2021 to early 2023, I independently explored logic-based techniques for augmenting domain expertise. This work involved researching the nature of learning and expertise, as well as producing prototypes and software documentation for a demonstration domain. This work is ongoing as a free-time research project.
