## About

Since April of 2024, I've been contracting with [ThinkCERCA](https://www.thinkcerca.com/), an education company that creates K-12 writing software and curriculum to help students become strong critical thinkers. In my work with ThinkCERCA, I'm developing LLM prompting techniques for automated writing feedback, systematically evaluating prompt performance, providing support to understand prompt engineering best practices.

In March of 2023, I started contracting as Prompt Engineer with [Scale AI](https://scale.com/) and [Remotasks](https://www.remotasks.com/en). In this work, I helped train generative AI on various topics, including science, mathematics, and coding. My primary responsibilities include crafting high-quality prompts for various applications and ensuring data quality. I've participated in multiple special projects in prompt development and quality review. I'm looking forward to the opportunity to bring my training and experience into new domains.

My PhD work centered on developing a theoretical framework for reasoning about actual causation, which involves analyzing a sequence of events to identify the action(s) that led to a specific outcome. I successfully implemented this framework using Answer Set Programming (ASP), a logic programming language. Additionally, I completed a fellowship with the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory from 2019 to 2021, during which I developed an innovative logical framework based on literature about the psychology of human reasoning regarding norm violations. I showcased a proof-of-concept of this framework within an NRL-developed cognitive system.

From late 2021 to early 2023, I independently explored logic-based techniques for augmenting domain expertise. This work involved researching the nature of learning and expertise, as well as producing prototypes and software documentation for a demonstration domain. This work is ongoing as a free-time research project.
