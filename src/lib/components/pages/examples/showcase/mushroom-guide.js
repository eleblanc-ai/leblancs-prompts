## Materials

Before you begin, gather the necessary materials and equipment:

- Martha tent (or a similar small greenhouse)
- Chestnut mushroom spawn
- Substrate (hardwood sawdust or a mixture of sawdust and supplemented wood chips)
- Spray bottle or humidifier
- Thermometer and hygrometer
- Exhaust fan and timer
- Indirect lighting (such as LED grow lights)
- Shelving units
- Micropore tape

Having all your supplies ready will make the process smoother and more efficient.

## Setting Up the Martha Tent

Setting up your Martha tent correctly is essential for creating the ideal environment for your Chestnut mushrooms to thrive. Follow these steps to ensure your tent is ready for mushroom cultivation:

1. Start by choosing a suitable location that has access to electricity and is away from direct sunlight and drafts.
2. Assemble the tent according to the manufacturer's instructions; a typical tent size is 2ft x 4ft x 5ft (60cm x 120cm x 150cm).
3. Install shelving units inside the tent to maximize growing space, adjusting the height of the shelves to accommodate the size of your fruiting blocks.
4. Set up the exhaust fan and timer near the top of the tent to remove stale air and regulate temperature and humidity.
5. Place the thermometer and hygrometer inside the tent at the same level as your fruiting blocks for accurate readings.

With your Martha tent properly set up, you're now ready to create the perfect growing conditions for your Chestnut mushrooms.

## Environmental Conditions

Maintaining the proper environmental conditions within your Martha tent is crucial for the optimal growth of Chestnut mushrooms:

- Humidity levels:
  - Primordia stage (when small mushroom pins first appear): 98-100%
  - Fruiting body stage (as the mushrooms mature): 88-95%
- Temperature range: 60-70°F (15-21°C)
- Lighting: Provide indirect light for 12-16 hours per day using LED grow lights, and avoid direct sunlight, which can cause the substrate to dry out
- Air exchange: Set the exhaust fan to run for 2 minutes on and 3 minutes off, or 15 minutes per hour, to help regulate humidity, temperature, and CO2 levels

Monitor the conditions regularly using the thermometer and hygrometer, and adjust as needed by misting with a spray bottle, using a humidifier, or adjusting the fan settings. Consistent environmental control is key to successful Chestnut mushroom cultivation.

## Inoculation and Incubation

To prepare the substrate:

1. Mix hardwood sawdust or a combination of sawdust and supplemented wood chips, aiming for a moisture content of around 60-65%.
2. Fill plastic bags with the substrate, leaving some room at the top for air exchange, and pack the substrate firmly to ensure good spawn distribution.
3. Sterilize the bags of substrate in a pressure cooker or steam sterilizer to eliminate contaminants, and allow the bags to cool before inoculation.

Once cooled, inoculate the substrate with Chestnut mushroom spawn under sterile conditions, using a clean workspace and wearing gloves to minimize the risk of contamination. Seal the bags with micropore tape to allow for air exchange while preventing contaminants from entering. Place the inoculated bags in the Martha tent and maintain a temperature of 70-75°F (21-24°C) for 2-3 weeks until the substrate is fully colonized. During this time, the spawn will gradually spread throughout the substrate, appearing as white, thread-like mycelium.

![A photograph of a person wearing gloves, inoculating a bag of sterilized substrate with Chestnut mushroom spawn in a clean, well-lit workspace. Image prompt written by Claude 3 and image created by DALL-E.](./mushroom-guide/workspace.jpg)

## Fruiting and Harvesting

When the substrate is fully colonized, initiate fruiting by cutting off the top of the bag containing the fruiting block, allowing the mushrooms to emerge from the surface of the substrate. Maintain high humidity levels (98-100%) to encourage primordia formation, which appears as small white bumps on the surface of the substrate. Mist the walls of the tent and the surface of the fruiting blocks as needed.

As the primordia develop into pinheads and then mature fruiting bodies, reduce the humidity to 88-95% to prevent the mushrooms from becoming waterlogged and to maintain their texture and flavor. Harvest the Chestnut mushrooms when the caps are fully developed but before they start to flatten out or the edges begin to turn upward. Gently twist and pull the mushrooms from the substrate, taking care not to damage adjacent pins.

After harvesting, remove any remaining stumps to prevent contamination and prepare for subsequent flushes. The fruiting block can produce multiple flushes over several weeks, with each flush typically smaller than the previous one.

## Troubleshooting

Despite your best efforts, you may encounter some issues while growing Chestnut mushrooms. If you notice any signs of contamination, such as green, black, or pink mold, remove the affected bags immediately to prevent the spread of contaminants. Dispose of contaminated substrates safely and clean the area thoroughly.

If the mushrooms are growing slowly or not at all, check the environmental conditions and adjust accordingly. Ensure proper humidity, temperature, and air exchange levels are maintained, and verify that the substrate was properly sterilized and inoculated.

If the mushrooms develop long stems and small caps, a condition known as "leggy" growth, increase the amount of fresh air exchange and slightly reduce humidity levels. This indicates insufficient air circulation or CO2 buildup.

## Conclusion

Growing Chestnut mushrooms in a Martha tent is a rewarding and accessible project for beginner mushroom growers. By providing the right environmental conditions, inoculating a suitable substrate, and maintaining proper hygiene, you can successfully cultivate delicious Chestnut mushrooms in the comfort of your own home.

As you gain experience, experiment with different substrates, supplement ratios, and environmental factors to optimize your yields and quality. With time and practice, you'll develop a deeper understanding of the mushroom growing process and be able to troubleshoot issues more effectively.

Start your mushroom-growing journey today and enjoy the satisfaction of harvesting fresh, homegrown Chestnut mushrooms! Not only will you have a tasty addition to your meals, but you'll also gain a newfound appreciation for the fascinating world of fungi cultivation.
